# marketing-campaign-analysis-pandas
A beginner-level marketing dataset project using Python &amp; Pandas
This is my **first GitHub project** as part of my journey to become an **AI-Enabled Analyst**.  
I analyzed a marketing dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to evaluate ad performance across different channels and campaigns.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Campaign N** had the highest CTR (10.97%)
- **Email** performed better than Social in terms of CTR
- Social had the highest spend, but Email was more efficient

## ðŸ“„ Output
The full analysis is in the notebook + PDF report.  
This is just the beginning â€” more ML/AI projects coming soon!
